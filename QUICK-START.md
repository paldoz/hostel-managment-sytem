## 📊 What's Built So Far

✅ Next.js 14 with TypeScript
✅ Tailwind CSS styling
✅ Glassmorphic design system
✅ Login page with authentication
✅ Data store with localStorage
✅ TypeScript types for all models

## 🎓 For University Defense

This Next.js version demonstrates:
- **Modern Framework**: Next.js 14 (industry standard)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout
- **Professional Architecture**: Component-based design
- **Scalability**: Easy to add database later
- **Best Practices**: Follows React/Next.js conventions

## 📝 Next Steps

Once the dev server is running, I'll build:
1. Dashboard with statistics
2. Student management (CRUD)
3. Room management
4. Fee tracking
5. Complaint system
6. Analytics with charts

## ⚠️ Important Note

If you see "node is not recognized" errors, it's because Node.js isn't in the system PATH. The `start.bat` file works around this by using the full path to Node.js.
